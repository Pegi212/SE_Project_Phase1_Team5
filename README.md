Phase II: User Requirements and Application Specifications 
Submission Deadline: 18.03.2024, 23:59 
1.	Chosen Development Model: 
We selected the optimal software development model by analyzing some crucial key factors . These factors consisted on : 
•	Development time , particular deadlines and team size 
•	Constant delivery and client frequent feedback
•	Project size and complicatedness of it.
•	Development flexibility 
•	Assessing the risk tolerance 
•	Checking if the project requirements coordinate with the chosen model attributes


Based on the factors mentioned above we came to the conclusion that the best model to go for is Incremental model . The selection of Incremental model depended on our development team size that consists on 4 collaborators versus development time that is speculated to be 6 weeks . Since the time constraints appear short , Incremental model grants the earlier delivery of the product to the client rather than Waterfall model which requires more amount of time to deliver and deploy. 
 The small amount of time does not allow us for a clear and detailed documentation of each version of the project. One of the most beneficial thing that Incremental model provides for us is the client collaboration and feedback , we selected incremental model because our client wants to interact with the project vastly .Various stakeholders have the chance to offer input at different levels of development since the requirements specification , development and validation are inter-leaved in this approach . Client requirements can change due to his preferences so the selection of Incremental model was done for the purpose of making the accommodation and settlement of change effortless and cost-effective , while producing the optimal final version that meets the specified client’s requirements and expectations. 
The division of work in increments enables the effective management and fast advancement of the project. Lastly this approach we intend to follow grants the possibility of constant validation and evolution. Incremental model supports the ongoing testing of each increment added in order to certify that the final version of the product is efficient and high quality.

Software architecture : 
System architecture :
Our website called “Dermo-Aesthetic Appointment System” was created to make it easier for patients and dermatologists in aesthetic clinics to schedule and manage visits. It is made up of multiple components that are interrelated that function as a unit to offer a smooth user experience.

Patients can use the online system to handle their appointments, view available timetables, and plan appointments according to their preferences. Dermatologists have access to control patient appointments, check their own schedules, and amend their availability. 

Component diagram :
Components description : 
•	Front-end component : When user communicates with the program the front-end component sends the request to the back-end server for example when a client signs in the frond end sends the request to the back-end which communicates with the database in order to store the information. The back-end server operates regarding to these requests by validating and verifying the information from inputs and connects with other components such as authorization system or database system . When the back-end server has performed the required operations for example checking appointment availability or booking an appointment , the response is produced and it is sent back to the front-end which modifies the user interface properly.
•	Back-end server and the database components : The back-end server connects with the database to get or save the information needed regarding different functionalities that the application offers . For example when the patient requests the free hours of the specified doctor , the back-end retrieves that information from the database and displays it to the patient . When the back-end processes requests from different users , it modifies the database , for example when a user cancels the appointment , the database is modified by adding a new available hour for a particular doctor. 
•	Authentication , authorization and back-end server : When the user logs into the platform or takes an action that requires authorization (such as booking an appointment ) , the frontend transfers the login information into the back-end server . The back-end server communicates with authorization and authentication component to make sure that user’s data is verified and valid . By checking the authorization status and particular user roles the back-end server judges if the user is permitted to perform the specified request. 
•	Booking engine and back-end server : The booking engine is connected with the back-end server , because when the user requests to book an appointment , he actually executes the booking algorithm which is performed in the back-end side. This algorithm is indicated by some other factors which are available hours , doctor’s timetable , what client selects according to doctor preference or time and date preference . When the client actually performs the operation of choosing the date , time and doctor the booking engine modifies the database and sends the confirmation message to all parties involved in the process. 
•	Esthetician management and back-end component : The back-end server facilitates the maintenance of profiles and availability for estheticians . When esthetician reloads the page or refreshes their schedule , the back-end component assesses these modifications and modifies the database . The frond-end part may be also connected with the back-end part to display esthetician profiles such as the available hours for esthetician varying on the current modified information .
•	Notifications and back-end server : The notification component is linked to the back-end server to transfer notifications to the users , for example when the booking process is performed the back-end component sends the request to the notifications side that indicate that kind of response . The notification side assesses these requests and delivers the message to the appropriate parties
