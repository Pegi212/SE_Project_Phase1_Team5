# Project Details

## Project Title: [Dermo - Aesthetic Appointment System]

## Problem Statement: 
[During our analysis and communication with our client we highlighted some of the main challenges faced by him while using his current system . For our client it is difficult to deal with his current appointment system,  he faces difficulties while navigating in the system during a registration process. This creates complexities because the contact information is being entered incorrectly sometimes . He faces difficulties in time management and also in monitoring the schedules,  appointments and keeping track of the patients . Another problem identified after the analysis was the irregular information storage , improper software quality and non-flexible software functionality.]
